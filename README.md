# Jets Application

### Description
The Jets Application has jets that load as the program starts.
Once the program has started you have 9 options to choose from.

1. List fleet
2. Fly all jets
3. View fastest jet
4. View jet with longest range
5. Load all Cargo Jets
6. Dogfight!
7. Add a jet to Fleet
8. Remove a jet from Fleet
9. Quit

Number one will list the fleet of stored Jets. Number 2 will list all the jets and how long they can fly until they run out of fuel. Number 3 will show the fastest jet in the fleet. Number 4 will show the jet with the longest range. Number five will load all available cargo trucks. Number 6 will put fighter jets into fight mode. Number 7 will allow the user to add a jet to the fleet. Number 8 allows the user to remove a jet from the fleet. Finally you can end the program by pressing the number 9.

When adding a jet to the fleet, the program allows you to enter a model name.  When entering a model name, start all entries with entering a "C" to store a Cargo Plane or, "F" to store a fighter jet.

For example,

Model: FTF150 Fighter. (Stores a Fighter Jet)
Model: CTF130 Cargo. (Stores a Cargo Carrier)

### Things Learned
After a bump in the road that had me stuck over the weekend, I was able to complete my project. I learned how important the details are over the weekend. I was stuck on importing from a text file, so I thought. My text file had extra lines that were not being occupied with text. I didn't think anything of it, but it was causing an array out of bounds error. Once I recieved help, I was able to move on and complete the project. There are a couple of bugs that I was not able to work out up to this point.

I need to work on writing README's to practice speaking the language.
