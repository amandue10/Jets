### Things Learned
I learned that not everything always comes together. I was stuck on reading from a file throughout the weekend. I was finally able to get the txt to read, but was given an array out of bounds error at run time. This was not a compile error but a run time error. I was unsuccessful in fixing the error, and that is where I am at today. I did try to move on and come back to this later, but found that was not a good approach. I am writing code and not able to check if it works because of the error. The menu works and the quit option works, but that is all that is functioning without bugs.
